Hollywood is a glamorous place with lots of glitz. Movies have larger than life action sequences, huge lavish parties with lots of pomp and splendor. The soundscape of every movie is filled with loud guns and soulful music scores.  Arrival of VFX has been a total game changer with the set pieces being bigger, the stakes being higher and the movies being louder. The popularity of marvel movies have helped accelerate this trend of going louder and bigger.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Quiet Place comes off as a pretty unique and refreshing take on the horror movie genre which proves that bigger is not necessarily better. The tale revolves around the Abbott family. First time director John Krasinski creates a very compelling and intense story with masterful camera work. The setting is a apocalyptic future where the world has been taken over my monsters, who are blind but have super sharp hearing. Survival requires making as little sound as possible. John Krasinski plays the role of Lee Abbott, while his real life wife Emily Blunt plays the role of Evelyn Abbott, the reel life wife of Lee Abbott. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story has been created around a simple premise. Only minimal VFX was used for the monsters. The story managed to retain my attention throughout. For a horror movie, the number of jump scares were very less for which impressed me. Jump scares seem like a cheap parlor trick to me when included in horror movies, breaking us from the state of complete attention. I digress. Throughout the course of the movie, we follow the lives of the Abbott Family, the parents and their two children, their smallest being killed by a monster. The entire family communicated using sign language, so as to make minimal noise, while also compensating for the girl Regan who was deaf. Evelyn was pregnant with a child during that period, raising the question as to why someone would want to bring a noisy baby into such a world.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life moved on smoothly for the Abbott family, until one day, a nail decided to ruin their life. Evelyn stepped on the nail on the stairs leading down to the basement and dropped the china dish she was carrying, thus creating a lot of noise. The monsters were alerted and were soon on the hunt. Evelyn managed to survive in this scenario using an alarm clock, and managed to deliver a baby in the meanwhile. Evelyn could give birth thanks to Noah, who managed to burn fireworks which distracted the monsters. In the meantime, Lee reunited with his wife, baby in hand, while Noah was met with an accident, colliding with a tractor, apparently under an impression that a monster was chasing him while returning. Regan, coming back from the place where her little brother was killed which she routinely visited, managed to find Noah near the tractor, alerted by the sound of fireworks. They managed to go to the roof of a nearby granary, lighting a signal to their father to come and rescue them. Lee managed to reunite with his children, until he met his fate at the hands of one of these monsters trying to protect them. The kids hurried back home in their car, and were cornered by another monster who had followed the sound of the car, albeit a bit late fortunately. Cornered in their basement, Regan discovered that the monsters were allergic to high frequency sounds, and it could incapacitate them for a short duration of time. The film ends with Evelyn cocking her gun after blowing out the brains of one of these monsters at point blank range, a triumphant smile on her face, having figured out a way to deal with these monsters once and for all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the movie was tightly written, it had it's flaws. I would highly recommend this movie to people who would like a different kind of movie, grounded and refreshing. The second half is full of thrills and you would be left at the edge of your seat throughout. A small run time of 1 hour and 30 minutes also adds to the compactness of the story making it a worthwhile watch.
