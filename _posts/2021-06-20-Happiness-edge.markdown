In these trying times, when Covid-19 has ravaged most countries, leaving countless dead and many more without jobs, the amount of people suffering from mental illnesses has also increased. The majority of the populace have been made aware about various mental health issues through various programs and NGO's. In most of the cases, the focus was on improving the negative aspects of the lives of afflicted patients. I would like to talk a bit about how we can take cues from the research done in the field of positive psychology to improve our lives and the lives of people around us, by instead focusing on the positives in our lives.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as our actions,opinions are shaped by the people who we are surrounded by, we also affect the actions and opinions of the people with whom we interact or come in frequent contact. Aspiring Broadway actors use a special kind of technique to embody the characters which they play and bring them to life. I would like to call it the `Outside In` technique. In this technique,to get into character, the actors first change their own outwardly behavior to mimic that of the character, which in turn is reflected internally while they are playing their roles. This is the classic example of the term *fake it till you make it*. If we force a smile, even if we are feeling a bit low, after smiling for long enough, actually we really do become more happy. Thus, by faking our happiness, we actually increase our own happiness. To understand why, let us take the example of a new born baby. A new born baby smiles when it sees anyone smile, laughs when it sees anyone laugh, although it may not understand why others are laughing. This is because of a special set of neurons in the human brain called `mirror neurons`. The mirror neurons cause us to involuntarily mimic the facial movements of a person who we are with. Since we mimic the person's body language externally, internally that is reflected by increased happiness or increased grumpiness. These set of mirror neurons also cause us to latch on to the mood of the people with whom we interact. We can use this to our advantage in our quest to spread happiness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we stay happy, then due to the mirror neurons as explained above, we can spread the happiness to other people around us. If we are happy, then our creativity and concentration ability gets a boost. If we smile while talking to someone, even if we feign it, in most of the cases, they also smile back involuntary due to the mirror neurons. We have seen many a times, that there are people who can light up an entire room just by their mere presence and enthusiasm. If we can increase our own happiness, and genuinely become happy, then our happiness has a `ripple effect` on the people who come in close contact with us. This is how we can also create a happy household and a happy family. Let's say we train our brain to focus on the good things in our life, thus improving our ability to notice opportunities in even dire notations, we can become more optimistic. Our optimism and happiness will brush off people who we interact with, thus making their lives more happy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staying happy can also come in good use, if you are in a lead role at your workplace. A grumpy and ill-tempered boss can spread negativity pretty quickly through his entire team thus affecting the team morale. Just like positive emotions are contagious, negative emotions are doubly contagious. Thus, if you are in a leadership position, staying happy and jovial causes the other people in your team to share your enthusiasm, thus increasing their own happiness, which leads to increase in creativity, team morale and profits to the company. This is why employees who work under a happy CEO also are happy by themselves. Even if we are not in a position of authority in a company, keeping ourselves happy would help us boost our own creativity and enhance the quality of our work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that a butterfly flapping it's wings in one part of the world can cause hurricanes in the other part of the world. This is famously known as the `butterfly effect`. Thus, our actions also have far reaching consequences, more than we can imagine. It is up to us, whether to spread positivity or to foster a pessimistic mindset and spread negativity. Hope I have been able to convince you to make the right decision.
