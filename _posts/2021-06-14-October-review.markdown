title: "October Movie Review"
---

The film started out being a bit boring initially, since I am not accustomed to watching these kind of slow paced movies. I normally watch action or thriller movies which are fast paced and action oriented. After watching the movie, I realized that this was just the kind of movie I needed to watch to escape the frantic scurrying and restlessness of daily life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoojit Sircar delivered a masterpiece through the form of the aptly titled **October**. The film featured Varun Dhawan in the role of Dan, a simple minded, yet rough tongued employee of a 5-star hotel in Delhi, interning there for his hotel management degree. At first, the character seemed really dumb, and kind of an idiot. As the movie progressed, the kind hearted Dan won me over. In the same five-star hotel at which Dan worked, there was an employee by the name of Shiuli, played by Banita Sandhu. She is the heart of the entire movie. For those who don't know, Shiuli is the official flower of the state of West Bengal in India. This flower made numerous appearances throughout the entire movie symbolizing the soul and essence of Shiuli Iyer, in short Shiuli, a bright and hard working hotel management student.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, Shiuli slipped accidentally from the railing on the roof of a 3 storied building. She suffered internal hemorrhage and critical injuries on her head. She was rushed to the hospital. Dan was not present on the scene and rushed to meet her as soon as he heard that Shiuli had asked for Dan before her accident. The doctors in the hospital diagnosed that she would not be able to move or speak again, as she had suffered severe brain damage. Although her chances of survival was low, it was Dan along with her mother, who took care of her, through thick and thin. Her uncle was in favor of giving her a peaceful death, since he thought that she would be a burden to her family if her current state prevailed. It was Dan and Shiuli's mother who did not give up hope, and insisted on continuing her treatment, despite of the rising medical bills. One time, Dan even paid for her medicines borrowing money from his friends.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a world where we need everyone to be efficient and ruthless, Dan was a clear misfit. He got into fights, misbehaved with guests. He wore his heart on his sleeve. It was only Shiuli who could see the gentle, loving person hiding behind the facade of the sharp tongued, hot headed Dan.Dan understood that and did his best to keep her alive, knowing that she may never walk or speak again. He loved her, knowing that he may not get anything in return.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After spending a long time at the hospital, Shiuli partially recovered and looked to be on a path to a full recovery. She was discharged from the hospital and brought to her home, where Dan took care of her, along with her mother and siblings. Dan took her out on her wheel chair to a nearby park and also kept her company, even though she still acted erratically and her movements were very limited. Despite the best efforts of her mom and Dan, she died of a collapsed lung soon after. The only gift that Dan received for all his efforts, was a single acknowledgment "Dan", where Shiuli acknowledged his presence. The tears in his eyes provided a clear mirror to his soul signaling that a simple acknowledgment was all he wanted, in return for all he had given and sacrificed. At the end of the movie, when Shiuli's mother was moving out of Delhi, she gifted Dan with Shiuli's favorite tree, a Shiuli tree which she had planted herself. Every October, when she was young, she used to pick the fallen Shiuli flowers and revel in their beauty. The tree remained a way for Dan to be with Shiuli even after she had left for her heavenly abode.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This film would always remain a memorable experience for me and a shrine to the beauty and warmth of *true love*.
