In the current pandemic scenario, where downsizing has become rampant in every work sector, the world may seem very bleak and full of uncertainties. Many people have lost their jobs and their livelihoods due to the ongoing pandemic. Some were lucky to avoid this cruel culling and managed to retain their jobs. Yet, they were in for a nasty surprise. Gone were the days when you could roam around in the office, learn from your co-workers, enjoy a perfect cup of coffee in the cafeteria. Instead, most people were constrained to live within the four walls of their home, their work life revolving around streams of emails and incessant meetings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work From Home(WFH) which initially came as a blessing, turned out to be a curse, blurring the lines between work life and personal life. A 9 hour work day extended well beyond the 12 hour mark and sometimes peaked at 14. Is not there a better way? If you ask me, I would say yes. There is a way. It lies in our ability to work **deeply**. Most of the time that an employee spends working remotely, working from home, is spent in idyllic conversations and meetings that have no net output.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest taking an alternative approach. Check your schedule and chalk out some sizeable chunks of time where you can work without getting interrupted. In those dedicated blocks of time, focus on the task at hand, keeping any smart gadgets outside your reach. Again, as you might be rightly wondering, *What if my job requires me to use the internet or a computer?* Before addressing this issue, let me highlight some of the benefits of working deep.
1. Working deep allows you to complete a significant amountof work in a short amount of time.
2. If you take less amount of time to do your work while maintaining high quality of output, that leaves you more time to devote in personal activities and hobbies. 
3. Working deep is also a technique to reach a state of `flow`, where your mind is stretched to it's limits and you are fully involved in the activity which you are pursuing.
    
Let us look at the definition of `flow`. Quoting from Wikipedia,
> Flow state, colloquially known as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energised focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, remaining in a state of flow, which can in turn be achieved by pursuing deep work also leads to increased satisfication and enjoyment in the same activity. Flow state also leads to increased focus, stretching the power of the human mind to it's limits, resulting in accomplishments which are deemed inhumane.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing a habit of deep focus is very difficult in this day and age where staying connected is the norm of the day. Most of the companies also push for holding meetings and conferences which do more bad than good. Our attention span has also become fragmented and short. The inundation of social media in our lives is also not helping. Technology is developing at a rapid pace, and you have to learn new things every day to stay at the top of your game both academically and professionaly. Those who can cultivate the habit of working deep can learn things faster than the rest, thus also developing the ability to create incredible things which add value and meaning to the world. They are also rewarded handsomely.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had previously promised, those whose work life involves working with computers, and are prone to distractions provided by the internet, can install the [Forest Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/forest-stay-focused-be-pr/kjacjjdnoddnpbbcjilcajfhhbdhkpgk?hl=en). This extension provides the functionality of restricting you from visiting sites which are blacklisted for a certain period of time, during which you grow a *Virtual Tree*. This is a fun and satisfying way of staying on the task at hand, preventing "unintenional" forays into cat videos on Reddit(definitely don't check out this site if you don't know about it). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have still not been able to convince you to work deeply, you can check out [this book](https://www.amazon.in/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B013UWFM52) by Cal Newport. It's an excellent read and may encourage you to delve into the **deep side**.
