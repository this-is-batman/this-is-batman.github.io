What sets apart the ultra-successful people from the rest of the population? Is it something innate inside them with which they are born? In most of the cases, the answer is No. The thing that catapults them to the heights of their respective careers or endeavors is their mentality, specifically, **The Growth Mentality**. If I have managed to capture your interest, let's explore the specifics of this mentality, and how, if we want, we can also harness this superpower.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth mindset is based on the belief that our basic qualities are things that we can cultivate through our own efforts. Although people may differ in every which way, in their initial talents or aptitudes, everyone can *change* and *grow* through **application** and **experience**. To support this fact, science comes to our rescue. There is a scientific term known as **neuroplasticity**.Let us look at the definition of Neuroplasticity as given in Wikipedia,

> Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity, or brain plasticity, is the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. These changes range from individual neuron pathways making new connections, to systematic adjustments like cortical remapping.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above paragraph may look like a lot of mumbo jumbo. Don't worry, let me break it down for you in simpler terms. Neuroplasticity says that you can basically *rewire your brain* to make it better at tasks which you want to accomplish. Let us take riding a bike as an example.When we learn about riding a bike, it takes some time before we can ride a bike smoothly. During this time, by practicing this very action, we strengthen the connections in our brain related to development of motor skills required to drive a bike. Similarly, the more we practice an action, the better we get at performing it. As opposed to popular opinion, our brain still retains the ability to form strong and new connections even after we reach adolescence. Thus, as the term goes, **it's never too late to start learning something new**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have established the fact that we can get better at something through practice, let us look at the habits of people who are advocates of growth mentality. These people believe that a person's true potential is unknown (and unknowable). It's impossible to foresee what can be accomplished with years of passion,toil and training. How does this help us? If you know that your abilities are not set in stone, and can be improved throughout your lifetime through **deliberate practice and effort**, you can then learn freely without the need for approval. You can then rise above the binary trap of success and failure, and rather see yourself as growing with each mistake, learning from every failure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can cultivate this kind of mindset, looking to **learn at every opportunity** without fearing failure, you can thrive during some of the most challenging times in your lives. This passion of *stretching yourself* and sticking to your efforts, even when things are not going well, is the hallmark of people with a growth mindset. In a world where we believe that everyone has fixed traits and everyone's abilities are fixed, success is equivalent to proving that you are smart, talented and validating yourself. In the world of changing qualities marked with constant growth, success is stretching yourself to learn something new, developing yourself. If you are a disciple of growth mindset, that means you do not see failure as a sign of your worthlessness, rather it provides a signal that you are *yet to achieve your full potential*. For the fixed mentality people, setbacks are a death sentence, making them question themselves and their abilities. For the growth minded people, they are motivating, informative input, a wake up call.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the next time you come home having flunked your exam, failed in tenure review or rejected from an interview, you have two choices.
1. Thrash yourself for not being good enough, wallow in self-pity, spiraling into a bottomless pit of despair. Doubt yourself, question your abilities.
2. Accept your limitations. See where you went wrong. Take failure as a temporary setback, providing you with an opportunity to improve yourself, and grow in the process. 

**What will YOU choose?**
